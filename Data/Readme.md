Source Files: VSB Power Line Fault Detection

Data Description
Faults in electric transmission lines can lead to a destructive phenomenon called partial discharge. If left alone, partial discharges can damage equipment to the point that it stops functioning entirely. Your challenge is to detect partial discharges so that repairs can be made before any lasting harm occurs.

Each signal contains 800,000 measurements of a power line's voltage, taken over 20 milliseconds. As the underlying electric grid operates at 50 Hz, this means each signal covers a single complete grid cycle. The grid itself operates on a 3-phase power scheme, and all three phases are measured simultaneously.
